# Interactive Visualization for AI Education

Senior Capstone, Group 21

The goal of this project is to design and develop a web-based interactive visualization tool for novices to learn about AI or machine learning (ML). The tool will enable users to actively learn about AI on their web browsers without programming, specifically by uploading their datasets (e.g., a set of images), train ML models, visually analyze results, and test them. We plan to evaluate our tool by conducting human-subject studies with potential users who aspire to learn about AI. We also aim to open-source the tool, so that anyone can use our tool for their learning.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

### `npm install -g yarn`
If you don't have yarn, please install yarn with this npm command.

### `yarn install`
Before run the yarn script, please install packages with this command.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
