    Let's move to creating our own model for sentiment classification. This page
    will walk you through three different models.
    <Spacer space='1vh' />
    <h1>Set up data and imports</h1>
    This section of code is to import any necessary Python libraries that we'll
    need for the rest of this notebook. Some packages may need to be installed
    since they are not built in to Python 3:
    <Spacer space='1vh' />
    <CopyBlock

    />
  </>
);

const visualization = (
  <>
    <Spacer space='1vh' />
    We also can visualize the results of our model using a confusion matrix. A
    confusion matrix helps us see which results are accurately classified and
    which are mis-classified, as well as how confident the model is in its
    classifications. The one below is interactive, so you can click on each
    block to see what data falls where.
