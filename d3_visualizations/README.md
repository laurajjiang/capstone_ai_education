# Standalone Visualizations

These are the original HTML files for the d3.js visualizations featured on the site and in the notebooks. These are here as an original source but should not be considered reliable - refer to the site and notebooks for the most updated versions.

To run any of these visualizations, create a Python server: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` or `python3 -m SimpleHTTPServer` if you are on MacOS.
